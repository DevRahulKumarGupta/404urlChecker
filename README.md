This script accepts the path to a CSV file as input, iterates through each row, and retrieves the content of the URL specified in the first column of each row. Subsequently, it appends the corresponding HTTP status, denoted as either '404' for Not Found or 'OK' for a successful request, to the end of the respective row in the CSV file. The modified CSV file retains its original structure, with an additional column labeled 'Status' containing the HTTP status information for each URL.
